## IDEAS

* Story has to be a quest
* Story can’t be too long or have to much different paths
* Story has to focus on a small team of main characters
* Story has to include how characters meet
* Story has to include some kind of magic (the gift, the art, le vif...) that can be visual
* Story has to include a two way trip
* Story has to include a small/light romance
* Story will be told by 2 points of view (the 2 ennemies)
* Story has to include religions (3?)
* One of the characters is resisting a invading force
* One of the character is commanding the invading force
* One of the characters is a female (invading force leader?)
* One of the society is matriarcal
* Invaders have no choice but invade to survive. They are not bad people 
* Landscape implies skirmishes
* Base one culture on Maori and one on Japanese
* Not a matriarcal society but a truly equalitarian one
* This is just a story in a vast world. Protagonists know some part of the world but it’s just not a part of this story
* One of the 2 heroes have kids if not both
* Education and relation to family has to be an important part of the story
* One of the 2 heroes have autistic traits. Can forget people easily. Don’t grief.
* One of the main places will be based on Mount Sunday, one on Abel Tasman, one on Cathedral Cove and one on Hobbiton and one on Tongariro
* One of the main characters will be uncomfortable with his/her image
* Include sword fight (katana Iaido style)
* Add a real evil foe they have to form an alliance to defeat (night king). Maybe something linked to the destruction of the nature (Godzilla)
