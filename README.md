- Start with rendering an empty battlefield.
  - Empty battlefield is a set of col * lines tiles that can have different states.
    - Where do the tiles get their state from?
      - Redux -> connect App to redux and add a 2 dimensions grid containing all the tiles state
  - BF -> Tiles -> Idle tile, attack tile...
